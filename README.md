# **_Second Semester Labs (SSL)_**


Clone this repository, using `git clone` in **CMD**,

To run my labs via console you need to have pytest installed:

`pip install pytest`

If already installed use this command instead:

`pip install --upgrade pytest` to upgrade your pytest to the newest version

now in CMD navigate to **TEST** folder (.../2-semester-labs/test) and use command:
    
`pytest`
